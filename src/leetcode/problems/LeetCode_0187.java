 *
 * 187. Repeated DNA Sequences
 *
 * All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as A, C, G, and T, for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
 *
 * Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
 *
 * Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
